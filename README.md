# Band Name Generator

This is a simple Python project built on Day 1 of my 100 Days of Code challenge.

It asks the user for:
- The name of the city they grew up in
- The name of their pet

Then it combines those two inputs into a fun band name!

## How It Works

1. Takes two user inputs using `input()`
2. Concatenates them into a band name
3. Displays the result using `print()`

### Example

**Input:**
- City: Patterson
- Pet: Rosa

**Output:**
- Your band name could be Patterson Rosa!
